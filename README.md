# Autobar Mobile

This repository contains the source code for the Autobar Mobile application, designed to provide users with a seamless experience for browsing available drinks and activating Autobar modules to dispense their selected beverages. It supports both Android and iOS platforms. Activation of modules is done via scanning a QR code present on the module, but NFC activation was going to be supported in the future.

**Note:** This application never ended up being published and is only intended for demonstration purposes.
